1/ Adding a new asset database table that store asset metadata. The path of the asset must be sotred in the metadata.
   This table is not available by the engine but usable by third party tools.
2/ Creating a small app that consumes the asset_compiler dll and display states oon compiled asset
3/ Making the engine work on Release build.
4/ Migrating the collision allocation to the new system.
5/ No dependencies on absolute path ?

At this point the Engine is capable of reproducing the old version that was a code mess and not tested :feelsbadman:

-> Trying to have a small electron application that reads asset database and display every mesh ?
   The same for the Material ?
