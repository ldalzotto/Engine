1/ Adding indexed vertex buffer binding
2/ Updating the render Mesh object to use the indexed buffer binding
3/ Update the gpu_test to render 4 cubes
4/ Image output comparison ?


5/ Defining precisely what is an "Allocator". The difference between a "Heap" object and an "Allocator" object. (The allocator object include the heap object)
    1) It simply allocates the dedicated ressource. External ressource token can be stored but they are never allocated or freed.
       Multi layer allocation is done by a "Composition" methods.
    * Done for the GraphicsAllocator, still to do for BufferAllocator and the Render.
