1/ Deciding about how scene tree node movements are handled by the middlewares.
    * Internal state checked by the middleware by iterating over registered entities ?
    * Or events stored in the scene when a node has changed. These events will be consumed and pushed to middleware depending of components.

2/ Designing a library that generalize deferred allocation. That can be used for ressource allocation and scene middleware component objects.

3/ Migrating the collision allocation to the new system.
