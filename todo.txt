1/ Adding indexed vertex buffer binding
2/ Updating the render Mesh object to use the indexed buffer binding
3/ Update the gpu_test to render 4 cubes
4/ Image output comparison ?

5/ Defining precisely what is an "Allocator". The difference between a "Heap" object and an "Allocator" object. (The allocator object include the heap object)
    Two possibilities here :
    1) It simply allocates the dedicated ressource. External ressource token can be stored but they are never allocated or freed.
       Multi layer allocation is done by a "Composition" methods.
    2) An allocation of one ressource may implicitly imply the allocation of another one, by passing the allocator object as parameter.

    The 1) seems to produce cleaner code but more work and code to write.
