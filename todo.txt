1/ We can improve the shader compiler so that we only need to write shader program parts that are not common.
   On compilation, the shader compiler can append the common parts.

2/ Deciding about how scene tree node movements are handled by the middlewares.
    * Internal state checked by the middleware by iterating over registered entities ?
    * Or events stored in the scene when a node has changed. These events will be consumed and pushed to middleware depending of components.

3/ Migrating the collision allocation to the new system.
