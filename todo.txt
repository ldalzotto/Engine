1/ Migrating the resource algorithm the new way of creating interface objects
   Migrating the render algorithm the new way of creating interface objects

1/ We can improve the shader compiler so that we only need to write shader program parts that are not common.
   On compilation, the shader compiler can append the common parts.
   -> This will invole to define types to shader assets in order to know if it's a color step shader (or another one in the future).

2/ Migrating the collision allocation to the new system.
